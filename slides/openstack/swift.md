---

- [Swift](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest) is the _distributed_, _eventually consistent_ object/blob store.
- In the dashboard, you can only manage <span class="color-yellow-400">containers</span> and <span class="color-yellow-400">objects</span>.

---

### <span class="color-yellow-400">Container</span>

- Think _Windows folder_ or _Linux directory_.
- Cannot be nested.
- <span class="color-yellow-400">Objects</span> must be stored in a <span class="color-yellow-400">container</span>.

---

### <span class="color-yellow-400">Object</span>

- Consists of the file to be stored and accompanying metadata.
- It is possible to create _metadata-only_ object without a file.
- Can move the objects between containers in dashboard.
