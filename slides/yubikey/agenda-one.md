<span class="color-yellow-400">Single factor authentication</span> with username and password are no longer sufficient.

Note:

The concept of “logging in” or password-protection has been used since approximately 1961. Utilising the username & password combo to access different files and services has been a staple of Internet services for decades. This simple idea allows a single company, or device, to offer services to virtually unlimited number of users, while maintaining their privacy at the same time.

The ubiquitous Internet and profiteration of social networking, however, changed everything. In late ‘80s and early ‘90s desktop computers were mostly stand-alone machines, sometimes connected to an internal business or academic network (LAN) and rarely connected to the Internet at large. Online personas are usually stand alone from your private information. You can now easily find out a person information online.
